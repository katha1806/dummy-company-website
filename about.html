            <p>Web design is the process of creating websites. It encompasses several different aspects, including webpage layout, content production, and graphic design. While the terms web design and web development are often used interchangeably, web design is technically a subset of the broader category of web development.</p>
            <p>Websites are created using a markup language called HTML. Web designers build webpages using HTML tags that define the content and metadata of each page. The layout and appearance of the elements within a webpage are typically defined using CSS, or cascading style sheets. Therefore, most websites include a combination of HTML and CSS that defines how each page will appear in a browser.</p>

            <h3>What we do</h3>
              <p>Developers take the visions and plans created by web designers (a separate, but related role) and use code to turn those designs into what you see on your phone, tablet, or computer screen. Since web development is THE cornerstone of all things tech (no websites, no mobile apps, no internet), you can see why this role is in high demand (and how knowing web developer skills will make you infinitely hirable).
                Meanwhile, it’s precisely that demand that makes web development a flexible entry point for tech newbies. Everyone needs a functional website (from your friend’s food truck to Facebook and Google) and that means there’s plenty of work to go around for web developers of all skill and experience levels.
                You can start off with the absolute basics (skills like HTML and CSS) and do paid jobs for friends and family, you can level up your skills with intermediate and advanced languages like JavaScript and Python and work at the highest levels of Big Tech, or you can land at any point in between. And THAT’s the beauty of breaking into tech as a web developer.</p>
